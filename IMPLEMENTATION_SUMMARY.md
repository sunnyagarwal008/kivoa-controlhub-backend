# Implementation Summary: AI Image Enhancement System

## Overview

Successfully implemented a complete AI-powered image enhancement system that runs as part of the Flask application. The system automatically processes product images using Google Gemini AI when products are created via the bulk upload API.

## Key Architecture Decision

**Worker runs as a background thread within the Flask application** - No separate process needed!

### Benefits:
- ✅ Simplified deployment (one application to manage)
- ✅ Automatic startup/shutdown with the application
- ✅ Shared application context and configuration
- ✅ Easy scaling with Gunicorn workers
- ✅ No additional process management needed

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Changes

**New Model: `ProductImage`** (`src/models.py`)
```python
class ProductImage(db.Model):
    id = Integer (Primary Key)
    product_id = Integer (Foreign Key → products.id)
    image_url = String(500)  # S3 URL of enhanced image
    status = String(20)  # pending, approved, rejected
    created_at = DateTime
    updated_at = DateTime
```

**Updated Model: `Product`**
- Added relationship to `ProductImage`
- Status flow: `pending` → `pending_review` → `approved`/`rejected`

### 2. New Services

**`src/sqs_service.py`** - AWS SQS Integration
- `send_message(product_id)` - Send product ID to queue
- `receive_messages()` - Receive messages with long polling
- `delete_message()` - Delete processed messages

**`src/gemini_service.py`** - Google Gemini AI Integration
- `download_image(url)` - Download image from S3
- `generate_enhanced_image_url()` - Generate enhancement prompts
- `enhance_image_description()` - Analyze images with Gemini

**`src/worker_thread.py`** - Background Worker Thread
- Runs as daemon thread within Flask app
- Processes SQS messages continuously
- Handles product image enhancement workflow

### 3. Updated Components

**`src/routes/products.py`**
- Modified `bulk_create_products` API
- Sends each product_id to SQS queue after creation
- Returns immediately (async processing)

**`src/app.py`**
- Starts worker thread on application startup
- Registers cleanup handlers

**`run.py`**
- Added graceful shutdown handling

**`src/config.py`**
- Added SQS configuration
- Added Gemini API configuration
- Added image enhancement settings

### 4. New Dependencies

Added to `requirements.txt`:
- `google-generativeai==0.3.2` - Gemini AI SDK
- `Pillow==10.2.0` - Image processing
- `requests==2.31.0` - HTTP requests

### 5. Setup Scripts

**`scripts/create_product_images_table.py`**
- Creates the `product_images` table

**`scripts/setup_sqs_queue.py`**
- Automatically creates AWS SQS queue
- Configures queue settings
- Outputs queue URL for .env

**`scripts/test_image_enhancement.py`**
- Tests all system components
- Validates configuration
- Checks connectivity (DB, SQS, S3, Gemini)

## Workflow

### 1. Product Creation
```
POST /api/products/bulk
{
  "products": [
    {
      "category": "Electronics",
      "raw_image": "https://s3.../raw.jpg",
      "mrp": 1000,
      "price": 900,
      "discount": 100,
      "gst": 18
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. API Response (Immediate)
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Successfully created 1 products and queued for processing",
  "data": {
    "created": 1,
    "products": [{"id": 123, "status": "pending", ...}]
  }
}
```

### 3. Background Processing (Async)
1. Worker thread receives message from SQS
2. Fetches product #123 from database
3. Downloads raw image from S3
4. Uses Gemini AI to analyze image and generate enhancement prompts
5. Creates 3 enhanced images (configurable)
6. Uploads enhanced images to S3: `enhanced/123/uuid1.jpg`, etc.
7. Creates 3 records in `product_images` table
8. Updates product status to `pending_review`
9. Deletes message from SQS queue

### 4. Result
```sql
-- Product updated
SELECT * FROM products WHERE id = 123;
-- status = 'pending_review'

-- Enhanced images created
SELECT * FROM product_images WHERE product_id = 123;
-- 3 rows with S3 URLs
```

## Configuration

### Required Environment Variables

```env
# AWS SQS
SQS_QUEUE_URL=https://sqs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/123456789012/product-image-processing

# Gemini API
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key
GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-1.5-flash

# Image Enhancement
ENHANCED_IMAGES_COUNT=3
```

## Setup Steps

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Create database table**
   ```bash
   python scripts/create_product_images_table.py
   ```

3. **Setup SQS queue**
   ```bash
   python scripts/setup_sqs_queue.py
   ```

4. **Get Gemini API key**
   - Visit: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
   - Create API key
   - Add to `.env`

5. **Update .env file**
   - Add `SQS_QUEUE_URL`
   - Add `GEMINI_API_KEY`
   - Set `ENHANCED_IMAGES_COUNT` (default: 3)

6. **Test configuration**
   ```bash
   python scripts/test_image_enhancement.py
   ```

7. **Start application**
   ```bash
   python run.py
   ```
   
   Worker thread starts automatically!

## Testing

### 1. Test Configuration
```bash
python scripts/test_image_enhancement.py
```

Expected output:
```
✓ All required environment variables are set
✓ Products table exists
✓ ProductImages table exists
✓ SQS connection successful
✓ S3 connection successful
✓ Gemini API connection successful
```

### 2. Test Bulk Upload
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/products/bulk \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "products": [
      {
        "category": "Electronics",
        "raw_image": "https://your-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/test.jpg",
        "mrp": 1000,
        "price": 900,
        "discount": 100,
        "gst": 18
      }
    ]
  }'
```

### 3. Monitor Worker Logs
Watch the application console for:
```
Worker thread started
Queue URL: https://sqs...
Received message for product_id: 123
Processing product 123 - Electronics
Generating enhanced image 1/3 for product 123
Created enhanced image 1 for product 123: https://...
Successfully processed product 123. Created 3 enhanced images.
```

### 4. Verify Database
```sql
-- Check product status
SELECT id, category, status FROM products WHERE id = 123;
-- Should show: status = 'pending_review'

-- Check enhanced images
SELECT * FROM product_images WHERE product_id = 123;
-- Should show: 3 rows with image URLs
```

## Production Deployment

### With Gunicorn
```bash
gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:5000 "src.app:create_app()"
```

Each worker has its own background thread:
- 4 workers = 4 concurrent message processors
- 8 workers = 8 concurrent message processors

### Scaling
Simply increase Gunicorn workers:
```bash
gunicorn -w 8 -b 0.0.0.0:5000 "src.app:create_app()"
```

SQS automatically distributes messages across all worker threads.
